It is a Dark and light themed calculator.
This project is a simple yet functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, capable of performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also features a toggle between light and dark themes, enhancing user experience and accessibility. Developing this calculator was a valuable learning experience, providing a solid foundation in web development. It allowed me to practice and understand the core concepts of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive functionalities.
